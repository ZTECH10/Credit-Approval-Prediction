💳🏦 **Credit Card Approval Predictor Project** 🏦💳

**Project Overview**:
In this project, I will automate the credit card approval process using machine learning. The goal is to predict whether an applicant should be granted a credit card based on various features.

**Dataset Description**:
The dataset contains information on applicants, including their credit history, debt-to-income ratio, delinquent credit lines, major derogatory reports, property value, and age of oldest tradeline.

**Features**:

1. BAD: Binary (1 = Client defaulted on previous loan; 0 = loan repaid) 🚫✔️
2. DEBTINC: Debt-to-income ratio 💵📊
3. DELINQ: Number of delinquent credit lines 📊
4. DEROG: Number of major derogatory reports 📊
5. VALUE: Value of Current Property 🏠💰
6. CLAGE: Age of oldest tradeline in months ⌛📆

**Approach**:
I'll employ a classification model to predict credit card approval. The process will involve data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

**Steps**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Handle missing values ✨
   - Remove duplicates 🗑️
   - Taking care of outliers 📊🧐
   - Normalize/standardize features 📏

2. **Model Selection**:

   - Decision Tree 🔄
   - Evaluate the model's performance 📈

3. **Model Training**:

   - Split data into training and testing sets 🧩
   - Train selected model on training data 🚀

4. **Model Evaluation**:

   - Evaluate the model's performance m accuracy metric 📊
   - Analyze confusion matrix 📉

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning (if needed)**:
   - Optimize model parameters for better performance ⚙️
