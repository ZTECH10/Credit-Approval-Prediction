# Credit-Approval-Prediction
Commercial banks receive many applications for credit cards every day. Manually analyzing them is time-consuming. 
Nowadays, commercial banks can use machine learning to automate this process. In this project, I will build a credit card 
approval predictor that makes decisions about whether an application should be approved or rejected. This is a classification
problem because the task is to predict who should be given credit and who should not. 

Task Feature Description:
1.	BAD: 1 = Client defaulted on previous loan; 0 = loan repaid (i.e., 1 means bad)
2.	DEBTINC: Debt-to-income ratio
3.	DELINQ: Number of delinquent credit lines
4.	DEROG: Number of major derogatory reports
5.	VALUE: Value of Current Property
6.	CLAGE: Age of oldest tradeline in months
